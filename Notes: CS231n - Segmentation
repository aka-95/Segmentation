Notes: CS231n - Justin Johnson - Segmentation
- segmentation as a task - assign labels to each pixel - output usually comes from the softmax layer and has form {n_classes x image widht x image height} 
  where n classes is th no .of classes of segmentation which are then  argmaxed to assign labels to each pixel - loss used is generally cross entropy 
  - data is very difficult to annotate

  
- Simplest approach - sliding window and classify - impractical
- Better - CNNs without FCs - but without downsampling, the compute requirements become prohibitively expensive - (ie 512 depth channels of 1024x2048 image) 
  but we know depth is essential for good learning, so Solution - downsample the images (std. maxpooling) and then upsample them (using NN, 
  Transposed conv(learned weights used), bed of nails, max unpooling(remenber the max index while pooling))

- Classifation +Localization as a task - two FC Layers/subnets to predict localization bbox coords(regression loss) and class confidences(classification loss) 
  respectively. issues arise when backproping if either of the two losses dominate. In such cases, hyperparameter is used to weight the losses appropriately. 
  this is tricky because our loss value itself is being changed by the change in hyperparameter so it is important to have a look at some other value that we 
  care about for tuning this hyperparameter. 
  Aside - pose estimation from a single image can be done by regressing like bboxes. ie regress for positions of different joints
